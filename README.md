# Analyze A/B Test Results 

## Introduction

In this project, I will analyze the results of an A/B test conducted by an e-commerce company using three approaches:

1. Perform hypothesis testing by manually coding the statistical calculations.
2. Use built-in methods from the `statsmodels` library to conduct the same test.
3. Apply a logistic regression model to evaluate the impact of the new page on conversions.

The company has developed a new web page aimed at increasing the number of users who "convert"â€”i.e., those who choose to pay for the company's product. The objective is to assess whether the new page is more effective than the existing one. Specifically, I aim to determine whether the company should:

- Implement the new page,
- Retain the old page, or
- Continue the experiment to collect more data.

## Data

There are two CSV files provided as part of this project:

### `ab_data.csv`
This file contains 5 columns:

| Data Column     | Purpose                                                                 | Valid Values              |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `user_id`       | Unique identifier for each user                                         | Integer values            |
| `timestamp`     | The time when the user visited the webpage                               | Date and time             |
| `group`         | The user's assignment in the A/B experiment: `control` or `treatment`   | `['control', 'treatment']`|
| `landing_page`  | Whether the user visited the old page or the new page                    | `['old_page', 'new_page']`|
| `converted`     | Whether the user decided to pay for the product (1 for 'yes', 0 for 'no')| `[0, 1]`                  |

### `countries.csv`
This file contains 2 columns:

| Data Column | Purpose                                              | Valid Values   |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `user_id`   | Unique identifier for each user                      | Integer values |
| `country`   | The country from which the user visited the website  | Country names  |
