# Analyze A/B Test Results

## Introduction
For this project, I analyzed the results of an A/B test conducted by an e-commerce company with the objective of assessing whether the new page is more effective than the existing one. Specifically, my goal was to determine whether the company should:
- Implement the new page,
- Retain the old page, or
- Continue the experiment to gather more data.
